# FPL Predictor

As the name suggests, this project is based on Machine Learning models to predict the most valuable assets in Fantasy Premier League. The data used for this predtiction is currently obtained from the official website of FPL. Although, the data currently used in our model is not enough in my persecptive.
The model gives good results but there is a lot of things that can be still be implemented on this.
This is my first draft and I am getting an accuracy of 87% on my hold out dataset. The model generalizes well, and I have alot of ideas of improving upon this in the future. Like, dividing the predictions based on the player i.e., different for forwards, midfielders, defenders and goalkeepers. 
Basically, my end goal is to achieve a program that can give out the best possible team for the upcoming gameweek(Solve the knapsack problem). The weekly transfers will be also be managed by the AI itself.
The definition of the best team will have different attributes. For e.g., best team to increase money would be different than the best team that would be for best total points. 

There is alot of depth in this project. Lets see, till where can I push this.
I am hoping to complete this project before the start of the next season.
